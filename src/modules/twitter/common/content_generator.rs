Day 11 🤖🤖🤖
I've spent most of my day to dig into `shell script`.
And with a last few hours of the day, I received a approval email from Twitter related to my developer account.
I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try some interesting thing ⏳🙆‍♂️
👉 Here is my repo: https://github.com/maemreyo/dev-works-logger

}

// This project is based on Rust, it's to help users to collect their data from Github (with GraphQL Github) and forward them to Twitter, Discord, Email (scheduled).
// My project is at very first day of development, so if anyone's interested about it, feel free to open issues, create PRs to contribute 💌
